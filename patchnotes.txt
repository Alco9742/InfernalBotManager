	- Account export: Removed PDF and Print
	- Account export: Added TXT (username:password[:region][:level]) - Selected rows or custom selection (by region / status).
	- Added auto clear Launcher and Queuer entries in infernal/configs/settings.ini before infernalbot start.
	- Fix for '00:00:00:00:00:00:00:e0' getting registered as HWID on some servers.
	- Fixed bug in autoupdater
Because of the bug in the autoupdate this update wont go automatically in the background while infernal is running, and due to a mistake all IN_USE accounts have been automatically set to READY_FOR_USE.
So please safestop your queuers and relaunch the manager so it can update and refetch the accounts asap.
